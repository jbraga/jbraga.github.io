  title: Worldnet API
  description: "# Introduction\nThe Worldnet API enables you to connect seamlessly\
    \ and securely to our [Omni-Channel Payments Platform](https://www.worldnetpayments.com/).\n\
    \nOur API's are built around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\
    \ principles and [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) definitions.\n\
    Complying to such industry standards means that we can offer developers a much\
    \ better experience by exposing predictable resource-oriented URL's as well as\
    \ a comprehensive range of HTTP response codes and verbs.\nMoreover, you have\
    \ the possibility to enable and take full advantage of [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)\
    \ controls to provide out-of-the-box `Discoverability` and `Functional-Awareness`\
    \ for your integrations.\n\nGet started on building full-featured payment applications\
    \ and join us in the Revolution of Intelligent Retail.\n\n# Authentication\nThe\
    \ Worldnet API uses a combination of API Keys and [Java Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)\
    \ to authenticate requests. \nAPI Key's hold all the necessary information for\
    \ issuing JWT access tokens which in turn are required to access protected resources\
    \ and operations.\nTherefore, before you can start making any calls, you must\
    \ generate an API Key and use it to obtain access tokens.\n\nPlease, make yourself\
    \ familiar with the following security schemes before proceeding:\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject:\
    \ <security-definitions> -->\n## Generating an API Key\nIn order to generate your\
    \ first API Key you must [sign up](#) for a developer account and follow the steps\
    \ below:\n1. [Log into the SelfCare System](#) with the credentials you received\
    \ in the welcome email.\n2. Under *Settings*, navigate to *API Keys*, and then\
    \ click the `NEW API KEY` button.\n4. Enter an alias and set the permission modes\
    \ for each Sub-API.\n5. Select the terminals that you want the API Key to be allowed\
    \ to operate.\n6. Back on the list, choose the action `View Authentication Key`\
    \ to be able to see your API Key.\n\n## Obtaining an Access Token\nIn order to\
    \ obtain an access token you must use the [authenticate](#operation/authenticate)\
    \ operation passing your API Key in the `HTTP Authorization` header with `Basic`\
    \ authentication scheme.\n\nIn the snippet bellow we show how to achieve that\
    \ using [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl). However, if you are not familiar\
    \ with command line tools we recommend [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).\n\
    \n```\ncurl https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/account/authenticate\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic <Merchant API Key>\"\n```\n\nFor every successful\
    \ request you should receive a response just like the one bellow containing the\
    \ information associated with your crendentials, such as hours to expiry and privileges.\n\
    Include the JWT Token from the `token` property in the `Authorization` header\
    \ with `Bearer` authentication scheme for following requests to prove your identity\
    \ and access protected resources.\n\n```\n{\n    \"audience\": \"devpayments.worldnettps.com\"\
    ,\n    \"boundTo\": \"<Key Alias>\",\n    \"tokenType\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"token\"\
    : \"<JWT Token>\",\n    \"issuedAt\": \"<Issue Date>\",\n    \"expiresIn\": \"\
    <Hours to Expiry>\",\n    \"enableHypermedia\": true,\n    \"roles\": [\n\n  \
    \  ],\n    \"allowedTerminals\": [\n\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFor security reasons, access\
    \ tokens expire after a certain amount of time.\nTherefore, your application must\
    \ implement a mechanism to keep track of `issuedAt` and `expiresIn` values in\
    \ order to decide the right moment to automatically request new tokens.\n\n**Note:**\
    \ Your application must not hard-code the lifespan of a token as the value of\
    \ `expiresIn` property is subject to change without prior notice.\n\n## Making\
    \ Authenticated Calls\nApart from the [authenticate](#operation/authenticate)\
    \ operation, the entire API requires `Bearer` authentication scheme and expects\
    \ a valid JWT token as proof of identity.\nThe [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl)\
    \ snippet bellow is an example of how to use your access token, in this specific\
    \ case, to request the list of available terminals in your account.\n\n```\ncurl\
    \ https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?pageSize=10\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer\
    \ <JWT Token>\"\n```\n\n**Note:** The API will issue a response with status `401\
    \ Unauthorized` for requests carrying an expired JWT.\n\n# API Requests\nWe provide\
    \ developers looking to integrate with our solutions with a full-featured **Sandbox**.\n\
    \n- Sandbox URL: https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant\n\nIn order to perform\
    \ actions on the API's resources you must combine your requests with the proper\
    \ [HTTP Request Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).\n\
    \nThe Worldnet API supports the following HTTP Methods which are sometimes referred\
    \ as *HTTP Verbs*:\n\nHTTP Method  | Description\n------------ | -------------\n\
    [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) | It requests\
    \ a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` are ready-only.\n\
    [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) | It is\
    \ used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in\
    \ state on the server.\n[PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH)\
    \ | It is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.\n[DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE)\
    \ | It deletes / cancels / reverts the specified resource.\n\n## Request Identifiers\n\
    The Worldnet API assigns a unique identifier for every request that comes in.\
    \ You can find your requests' identifiers either in the `X-Request-Id` header\
    \ or in the Error field `debugIdentifier`.\n\nRequest ID's are part of an effort\
    \ to speed troubleshooting by facilitating communication between clients and our\
    \ support team.\nSince we keep track of all request identifiers in our log files,\
    \ you just need to inform the request's identifier when asking us to assist you\
    \ with problems that might come up during your integrations.\n\n## Request Headers\n\
    HTTP Header  | Description\n------------ | -------------\n[Accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept)\
    \ | The response format expected by your application.<br />The Worldnet API only\
    \ produces `application/json` response format.\n[Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language)\
    \ | It advertises which languages the client is able to understand, and which\
    \ locale variant is preferred.<br />The Worldnet API fully supports English `en`\
    \ and French `fr` languages.\n[Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)\
    \ | The body format of the request your application is sending to the API.<br\
    \ />The Worldnet API only consumes `application/json` content type.\n[Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization)\
    \ | It must contain contain the credentials (API Key or JWT Access Token) to authenticate\
    \ your application.<br />The API will issue a `401 Unauthorized` response with\
    \ the `WWW-Authenticate` header attached if your application fails to use this\
    \ header properly.\n\n## Partial Updates\nPartial update requests are signaled\
    \ with the HTTP method `PATCH`.\nTo perform partial updates, clients must specify\
    \ only the properties that have changed.\n\n**Note:** To clear the content of\
    \ a property, supply an empty value.\n\n## Testing Requests\nEventually it will\
    \ be necessary to perform some transactions.\nFor resources such as testing credit\
    \ cards and simulated responses, see [Testing Resources](https://docs.worldnettps.com/doku.php?id=developer:integration_docs:testing-guide#testing_resources).\n\
    \n# API Responses\nClient applications must be able to handle JSON body format\
    \ as well as a range of [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\
    \ when processing responses.\nSome resources might also include contextual hypermedia\
    \ links. We strongly recommend that clients use these links to request more information\
    \ or perform additional actions on a given resource.\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\n\
    The Worldnet API has adopted a comprehensive range of status codes where `2XX`\
    \ statuses are returned for successful requests and `4XX` or `5XX` for failed\
    \ requests.\n\nThe full range of status codes supported by Worldnet:\n\nHTTP Status\
    \ Code  | Description\n----------------- | -------------\n[200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has succeeded.\n[201 Created](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a\
    \ resource.\n[204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204)\
    \ | Indicates that the server successfully executed the method but returns no\
    \ response body.<br />This status is sent especifically to respond to `DELETE`\
    \ requests.\n[400 Bad Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400)\
    \ | Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to malformed\
    \ request syntax or schema violation.\n[401 Unauthorized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401)\
    \ | Indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication\
    \ credentials.<br />This status is sent with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that\
    \ contains information on how to authorize correctly.\n[403 Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403)\
    \ | Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize\
    \ it due to the lack of permissions.<br />Re-authenticating will make no difference\
    \ until the proper permissions and terminals are added to the API Key.\n[404 Not\
    \ Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) | Indicates\
    \ that the server cannot find the requested resource.\n[405 Method Not Allowed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405)\
    \ | Indicates that the request method is known by the server but is not supported\
    \ by the target resource.\n[406 Not Acceptable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/406)\
    \ | Indicates that the server cannot produce a response matching the value from\
    \ `Accept` header.\n[415 Unsupported Media Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/415)\
    \ | Indicates that the server refuses to accept the request because the payload\
    \ format described by the `Content-Type` is unsupported.\n[422 Unprocessable Entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422)\
    \ | Indicates that the server understands the content type of the request entity,\
    \ and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to proceed\
    \ due to semantic errors or failed business validations.\n[500 Internal Server\
    \ Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) | Indicates\
    \ that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling\
    \ the request.\n[501 Not Implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/501)\
    \ | Indicates that the server does not yetsupport the functionality required to\
    \ fulfill the request, but might in the future.\n\n## Error Handling\nFor all\
    \ errors Worldnet returns an error response body that includes additional details\
    \ in the format below:\n\n```\n{\n    \"debugIdentifier\": \"ae6d75eb-381b-4a01-9f49-fdff12e3848b\"\
    ,\n    \"details\": [\n        {\n            \"errorCode\": \"X_400_002\",\n\
    \            \"errorMessage\": \"Unable to deserialize value\",\n            \"\
    source\": {\n                \"location\": \"BODY\",\n                \"resource\"\
    : \"TipType\",\n                \"property\": \"type\",\n                \"value\"\
    : \"VARIABLE\",\n                \"expected\": \"Acceptable values: [PERCENTAGE,\
    \ FIXED_AMOUNT]\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nError messages are\
    \ intented to help developers to fix any problems that may come up during integration.<br\
    \ />However, if you ever have a hard time troubleshooting an issue or even wish\
    \ to make a suggestion, do not hesitate to [contact us](https://worldnettps.com/contact/).\n\
    Do not forget to send us the `debugIdentifier` along with your inquiries.\n\n\
    ## HATEOAS (Hypermedia Links)\n[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)\
    \ is a powerful mechanism when it comes to enabling self-discoverability, reducing\
    \ invalid state transition calls and protecting your application against unexpected\
    \ changes on resources URL's.\n\nThis snippet from a sample `payments` response\
    \ shows the list of hypermedia controls that represent the operations available\
    \ for the newly created payment resource.\n\n```\n\"links\": [\n    {\n      \
    \  \"rel\": \"capture\",\n        \"method\": \"PATCH\"\n        \"href\": \"\
    https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS/capture\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"refund\",\n        \"method\": \"POST\"\n\
    \        \"href\": \"https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS/refunds\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"update\",\n        \"method\": \"PATCH\"\n\
    \        \"href\": \"https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"self\",\n        \"method\": \"GET\"\n   \
    \     \"href\": \"https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n        \"rel\": \"reverse\",\n        \"method\": \"DELETE\"\
    \n        \"href\": \"https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/transaction/payments/GH2AERQEJS\"\
    \n    }\n]\n```\n\n# Pagination\nWorldnet implements cursor-based pagination which\
    \ is sometimes referred as continuation token pagination.\nThis pagination approach\
    \ works by returning a pointer to a specific item in the dataset. On subsequent\
    \ requests, the server returns results after the given pointer.\n\nClients don't\
    \ need to worry about implementing complex pagination mechanism in their applications\
    \ as Worldnet returns, for all paginated resources, the total count and a hypermedia\
    \ link that can be used to load more results.\n```\n\"links\": [\n    {\n    \
    \    \"rel\": \"next\",\n        \"method\": \"GET\"\n        \"href\": \"https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?next=CWY4XRGUUY\"\
    \n    }\n],\n\"totalCount\": 2\n```\n\nThe default and maximum number of elements\
    \ per page is `100`, but it can be changed by adding the query parameter `pageSize`\
    \ to requests as follows:\n```\ncurl https://devpayments.worldnettps.com/merchant/api/v1/account/terminals?pageSize=5\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer\
    \ <JWT Token>\"\n```\n\n**Note:** For performance reasons, the elements inside\
    \ of a paginated list only represent a compact version of the resource listed.\n\
    To retrieve the full version of a given resource, client applications must make\
    \ a subsequent request using the proper hypermedia link.\n\n# Versioning\nVersioning\
    \ ensures that changes are backward compatible. The Worldnet API uses a major\
    \ and minor version nomenclature to manage changes.\n\n## Major Versions\nMajor\
    \ version numbers will reflect in the REST URL, for example `/api/v1/transaction/payments`.\n\
    \nCurrently, **v1** is the only supported major version.\n\n## Minor Versions\n\
    Minor and backward-compatible changes will be advertised via `X-API-Version` response\
    \ header, for example `X-API-Version: 2020-01-01`.\n\nDevelopers should use this\
    \ header to keep track of new features and optimisations that might benefit their\
    \ applications.\n"
